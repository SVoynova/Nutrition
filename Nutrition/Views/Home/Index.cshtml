        In theory, keeping a food diary is a great idea, but how many of us have failed after
        just one day? Or even after the first meal? If you’ve given up, then you’re not alone, and
        it’s probably not your fault.

        However, there are many excellent reasons to keep a food diary. If you want to lose weight,
        eat better, or figure out what’s triggering your IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), then a food
        log is probably one of the first things a nutritionist or dietitian will ask you to do. That's
        why we have decided to create a place for self improvement, reaching goals and aspirations
        and we hope it makes the process at least a little bit easier.
